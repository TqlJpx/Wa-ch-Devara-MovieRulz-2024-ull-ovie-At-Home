Devara: A Deep Dive into Jr. NTR's Epic Action Saga

Where to Watch Devara:

Devara: Part 1, the highly anticipated Telugu action drama starring Jr. NTR, Saif Ali Khan, and Janhvi Kapoor, hit theatres worldwide on September 27, 2024. While the theatrical run is ongoing, fans eagerly await its digital release.

What is the movie Devara about? What is the story of Devara? What is the Devara movie story?

Devara: Part 1 unfolds a multi-layered narrative set against the backdrop of the Ratnagiri mountains and the infamous Red Sea, a treacherous stretch of water steeped in the blood of past battles. The story begins with a group of policemen investigating a mysterious figure known as 'Yethi', leading them to encounter the formidable Bhairava, a chieftain involved in smuggling operations.

The narrative then shifts to the 1980s, revealing the history of the coastal villages and their inhabitants, once valiant warriors who defended the seas but now reduced to smugglers. Devara, a powerful chieftain, leads a group involved in smuggling for Muruga, alongside Bhairava. However, Devara's conscience awakens when he discovers they are unknowingly trafficking illegal arms used in robberies. He resolves to stop the illicit activities, causing friction with other chieftains, including Bhairava, who plots to eliminate him.

Devara mysteriously disappears after a failed assassination attempt, leaving behind a chilling message vowing to punish those who continue smuggling. Years pass, and the villagers embrace fishing as their livelihood, living under the shadow of Devara's invisible presence, who ruthlessly eliminates any smugglers who dare to venture into the Red Sea.

The story then focuses on Devara's son, Vara, a timid young man who contrasts sharply with his father's legendary bravery. Vara strives to help his family move on from the pain of Devara's perceived abandonment. The narrative also introduces Thangam, the daughter of another village chieftain, and explores the budding romance between Vara and Thangam.

Some critics praised the action sequences, visuals, and performances, particularly by Jr. NTR and Saif Ali Khan, while others found the narrative predictable and the second half lacking in depth. The ultimate verdict on its success will depend on its continued box office performance and audience reception in the coming weeks.

Is ‘Devara’ Streaming?

If Devara arrives on Disney+ exactly 100 days after its theatrical release, that would mean the sequel will be made available on September 22, 2024. However, this date is a Sunday, so there is a good chance that the movie will end up on the service a few days before or a few days after said date. Audiences who have yet to subscribe to the streaming platform can choose from two available options.
